**1. First-Come, First-Served Scheduling**
By far the simplest CPU-scheduling algorithm is the first-come, first-served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm. With this scheme, the process that requests the CPU first is allocated the CPU first.

**2. Shortest-Job-First Scheduling**
This algorithm associates with each process the length of the processâ€™s next CPU burst. When the CPU is available, it is assigned to the process that has the smallest next CPU burst.

**3. Priority Scheduling**
Apriority is associated with each process, and the CPUis allocated to the process with the highest priority.

**4. Round-Robin Scheduling**
It is similar to FCFS scheduling, but preemption is added to enable the system to switch between processes. A small unit of time, called a time quantum or time slice, is defined. A time quantumis generally from 10 to 100 milliseconds in length.

**5. Multilevel Queue Scheduling**
Another class of scheduling algorithms has been created for situations in which processes are easily classified into different groups. A multilevel queue scheduling algorithm partitions the ready queue into several separate queues.

**6. Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling**
The multilevel feedback queue scheduling algorithm, in contrast, allows a process tomove between queues. The idea is to separate processes according to the characteristics of their CPU bursts.
