**1. Why is the operating system important?**

OS is the most essential and vital part of a computer without which it is considered useless. It enables an interface or acts like a link for interaction between computer software that is installed on OS and users. It also helps to communicate with hardware and also maintains balance among hardware and CPU. It also provides services to users and a platform for programs to run on. It performs all common tasks applications require. 


**2. What's the main purpose of an OS? What are the different types of OS?**
The main purpose of an OS is to execute user programs and make it easier for users to understand and interact with computers as well as run applications. It is specially designed to ensure that the computer system performs better by managing all computational activities. It also manages computer memory, processes, and operation of all hardware and software.

Types of OS:
Batched OS (Example: Payroll System, Transactions Process, etc.)
Multi-Programmed OS (Example: Windows O/S, UNIX O/S, etc.)
Timesharing OS (Example: Multics, etc.)
Distributed OS (LOCUS, etc.)
Real-Time OS (PSOS, VRTX, etc.)


**3. What are the benefits of a multiprocessor system?**

A Multiprocessor system is a type of system that includes two or more CPUs. It involves the processing of different computer programs at the same time mostly by a computer system with two or more CPUs that are sharing single memory. 

Benefits:
Such systems are used widely nowadays to improve performance in systems that are running multiple programs concurrently. 
By increasing the number of processors, a greater number of tasks can be completed in unit time. 
One also gets a considerable increase in throughput and is cost-effective also as all processors share the same resources.
It simply improves the reliability of the computer system.


**4. What is GUI?**

GUI (Graphical User Interface) is basically a type of user interface that allows users to use graphics to interact with OS. GUI is created because it is more user-friendly, less complex, and easier to understand rather than a command-line interface. Its main goal is to increase efficiency and ease of use. Instead of having to memorize commands, users can just click on a button to simply execute the procedure. Examples of GUI include Microsoft Windows, macOS, Appleâ€™s iOS, etc
